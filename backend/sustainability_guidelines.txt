1. Identify Relevant Technical Indicators
- Measure performance metrics like load time and energy usage.
- Use tools such as Lighthouse or WebPageTest to assess efficiency.
- Data-driven insights help prioritize sustainable improvements.

2. Minify Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Remove unnecessary characters (e.g., whitespace, comments) from code.
- Reduces file sizes, leading to faster load times and lower energy consumption.

3. Use Code-Splitting Within Projects
- Divide code into smaller chunks that load only when needed.
- Prevents users from downloading unnecessary code, enhancing performance.

4. Apply Tree Shaking To Code
- Eliminate unused code from final bundles during the build process.
- Results in leaner applications with reduced data transfer.

5. Ensure Your Solutions Are Accessible
- Implement semantic HTML and ARIA roles to support assistive technologies.
- Accessible sites are more efficient and user-friendly for all visitors.

6. Avoid Code Duplication
- Refactor repetitive code into reusable components or functions.
- Simplifies maintenance and reduces overall codebase size.

7. Rigorously Assess Third-Party Services
- Evaluate the necessity and performance impact of external scripts.
- Remove or replace services that degrade site efficiency.

8. Use HTML Elements Correctly
- Employ semantic tags (e.g., <article>, <nav>, <section>) appropriately.
- Enhances accessibility and reduces reliance on additional scripts.

9. Resolve Render Blocking Content
- Defer or asynchronously load non-critical CSS and JavaScript.
- Improves initial page rendering speed and user experience.

10. Provide Code-Based Way-Finding Mechanisms
- Implement skip links and landmarks to facilitate keyboard navigation.
- Supports users with disabilities and improves overall site usability.

11. Implement Lazy Loading
- Delay loading of images and videos until they are in the viewport.
- Reduces initial page load time and conserves bandwidth.

12. Optimize Images and Media
- Compress images and use modern formats like WebP.
- Ensures faster loading and lower energy consumption.

13. Use System Fonts
- Prefer system-default fonts over custom web fonts.
- Eliminates additional font file downloads, enhancing performance.

14. Implement Caching Strategies
- Use browser and server-side caching to store frequently accessed resources.
- Minimizes redundant data transfers and speeds up repeat visits.

15. Reduce HTTP Requests
- Combine files and use CSS sprites to minimize the number of server requests.
- Streamlines loading processes and reduces server load.

16. Utilize Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Serve content from geographically distributed servers.
- Decreases latency and energy usage by delivering data closer to users.

17. Optimize Server Response Times
- Enhance backend performance through efficient coding and database queries.
- Faster responses lead to improved user experience and lower energy use.

18. Implement Responsive Design
- Design layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
- Ensures optimal performance and usability across different platforms.

19. Use Efficient CSS and JavaScript Frameworks
- Select lightweight frameworks that meet project needs without excess.
- Avoids bloated codebases and unnecessary functionality.

20. Monitor and Optimize Performance Regularly
- Continuously assess site metrics and make iterative improvements.
- Maintains high efficiency and adapts to evolving best practices.

21. Educate Team on Sustainable Practices
- Train developers and stakeholders on eco-friendly coding standards.
- Promotes a culture of sustainability within the development process.

22. Document Sustainable Development Guidelines
- Maintain clear documentation on sustainability protocols and decisions.
- Facilitates knowledge sharing and consistent application of best practices.

23. Engage in Community Sustainability Initiatives
- Participate in forums and groups focused on green web development.
- Collaborate to advance industry-wide sustainability efforts.

24. Set and Review Sustainability Goals
- Establish measurable objectives for reducing digital emissions.
- Regularly evaluate progress and adjust strategies accordingly.
